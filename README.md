# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This script performs sentiment analysis on a group of tweets obtained from a live twitter feed using the twitter streaming library.
Using MultiNomial Naive Bayes model trained on a existing corpus of labelled tweets, I was able to classify tweets as Positive, Negative, Neutral or Irrelevant.
The pre labelled tweets can be found in the full-corpus.csv.
